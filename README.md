# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

Welcome to Project 2! It's time to start modeling.

**Primary Learning Objectives:**
1. Creating and iteratively refining a regression model
2. Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to practice the modeling process
3. Providing business insights through reporting and presentation.

You are tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale.

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.

Secondly, we are hosting a competition on Kaggle to give you the opportunity to practice the following skills:

- Refining models over time
- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process
- The use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science

As always, you will be submitting a technical report and a presentation. **You may find that the best model for Kaggle is not the best model to address your data science problem.**

## Set-up

Before you begin working on this project, please do the following:

1. Sign up for an account on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
2. **IMPORTANT**: Click this link [Regression Challenge Sign Up](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsir-420-project-2-regression-challenge/rules) to **join** the competition (otherwise you will not be able to make submissions!) and click "I understand and accept."
3. Review the material on the [DSIR-420 Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsir-420-project-2-regression-challenge/overview)
4. Review the [data description](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt).

## The Modeling Process

1. The train dataset has all of the columns that you will need to generate and refine your models. The test dataset has all of those columns except for the target that you are trying to predict in your Regression model.
2. Generate your regression model using the training data. We expect that within this process, you'll be making use of:
    - train-test split
    - cross-validation / grid searching for hyperparameters
    - strong exploratory data analysis to question correlation and relationship across predictive variables
    - code that reproducibly and consistently applies feature transformation (such as the preprocessing library)
3. Predict the values for your target column in the test dataset and submit your predictions to Kaggle to see how your model does against unknown data.
    - **Note**: Kaggle expects to see your submissions in a specific format. Check the challenge's page to make sure you are formatting your CSVs correctly!
    - **You are limited to models you've learned in class**. In other words, you cannot use XGBoost, Neural Networks or any other advanced model for this project.
4. Evaluate your models!
    - consider your evaluation metrics
    - consider your baseline score
    - how can your model be used for inference?
    - why do you believe your model will generalize to new data?

## Submission

Materials must be submitted by the beginning of class on **Friday, May 15**.

The last day for the Kaggle competition will be **Friday, May 15**.

Your technical report will be hosted on Github Enterprise. Make sure it includes:

- A README.md (**that isn't this file**)
- Jupyter notebook(s) with your analysis and models (renamed to describe your project)
- **At least one** successful prediction submission on [DSIR-420 Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsir-420-project-2-regression-challenge/) --  you should see your name in the "[Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsir-420-project-2-regression-challenge/leaderboard)" tab.
- Data files
- Presentation slides
- Any other necessary files (images, etc.)

**Check with your local instructor for how they would like you to submit your repo for review.**

---

## Presentation Structure

- **Must be within time limit established by local instructor.**
- Use Google Slides or some other visual aid (Keynote, Powerpoint, etc).
- Consider the audience. **Check with your local instructor for direction**.
- Start with the **data science problem**.
- Use visuals that are appropriately scaled and interpretable.
- Talk about your procedure/methodology (high level).
- Talk about your primary findings.
- Make sure you provide **clear recommendations** that follow logically from your analyses and narrative and answer your data science problem.

Be sure to rehearse and time your presentation before class.

## Rubric
Your local instructor will evaluate your project (for the most part) using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.

**Scores will be out of 27 points based on the 9 items in the rubric.** <br>
*3 points per section*<br>

| Score | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **0** | *Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item.* |
| **1** | *Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **2** | *Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **3** | *Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration.* |

### The Data Science Process

**Problem Statement**
- Is it clear what the student plans to do?
- What type of model will be developed?
- How will success be evaluated?
- Is the scope of the project appropriate?
- Is it clear who cares about this or why this is important to investigate?
- Does the student consider the audience and the primary and secondary stakeholders?

**Data Cleaning and EDA**
- Are missing values imputed appropriately?
- Are distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?

In order to pass the project, students must earn a minimum score of 1 for each category.
- Earning below a 1 in one or more of the above categories would result in a failing project.
- While a minimum of 1 in each category is the required threshold for graduation, students should aim to earn at least an average of 1.5 across each category. An average score below 1.5, while it may be passing, means students may want to solicit specific feedback in order to significantly improve the project before showcasing it as part of a portfolio or the job search.

### REMEMBER:

This is a learning environment and you are encouraged to try new things, even if they don't work out as well as you planned! While this rubric outlines what we look for in a _good_ project, it is up to you to go above and beyond to create a _great_ project. **Learn from your failures and you'll be prepared to succeed in the workforce**.
